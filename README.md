# dynamical-systems-for-machine-learning
Simple dynamical systems to test machine learning algorithms. In the past I have had to write several little games or dynamical systems to test learning algorithms. This is very very tedious so I thought I would write a few and put them here to save other people time. They are set up with the intent to use TensorFlow on them. They give there output in the form of minibatches so it should be seamless to use. Right now it is just a circle bouncing with gravity in a box. I will add more and examples of to use them on the TensorFlow RNN example.

# Cannon
Here is the little gif I made of the simulation. It produces 28x28 = 784 vectors (Because thats the same size as mnist shhhh).
